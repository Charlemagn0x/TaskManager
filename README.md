This repository hosts a backend service written in Rust, leveraging the Rocket web framework to manage tasks. The service operates an HTTP server on port 8000, facilitating the creation, retrieval, and deletion of tasks through specific routes. Task data is stored in an in-memory list, allowing for quick and efficient data handling without the need for external database connections. This implementation demonstrates the power and simplicity of using Rust and Rocket for web service development, showcasing how in-memory storage can be utilized for managing data in a lightweight and performant manner.
